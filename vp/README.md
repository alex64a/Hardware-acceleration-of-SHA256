# INSTRUCTIONS

To compile this project you must link the SYSTEMC library to your
installation folder (usually located in /usr/local/system-2.3.1/). 
Enter the following command: 

***export SYSTEMC=/usr/local/system-2.3.1/***

After you have linked the SYSTEMC directory to the Makefile, 
next step is to include libsystemc-2.3.1.so with the following command:

***sudo cp /usr/local/system-2.3.1/lib-linux64/libsystemc-2.3.1.so /lib/***
